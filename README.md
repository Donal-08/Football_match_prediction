# Football_match_prediction
In this project, I tried to predict if a team will win a football match in the English Premier League (EPL), given
- the **opposition team**, **venue** , **time of play(day/night)**, **day of the week** on which the match is to be played.

## Steps :-
- Web-Scraping the match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas from the [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats) website
- Data Pre-processing and cleaning using pandas.
- Make predictions about who will win a match with scikit-learn using various algorithms
- Algorithms include : **Random Forest Classifier**, **SVM** and more ....
- Measure error and improve our predictions.
