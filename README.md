# Football_match_prediction
In this project, I tried to predict if a team will win a football matche in the English Premier League (EPL), given
- the **opposition team**, **venue** , **time of play(day/night)**, **day of the week** on which the match is to be played.

## Steps :-
- Scrape match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.
- Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.
- Make predictions about who will win a match using scikit-learn using several algorithms
- Algorithms include : **Random Forest Classifier**, **SVM** and more ....
- Measure error and improve our predictions.
